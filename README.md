# Solar Atlas (Research internship)

*Date: October 2017*

This repository holds python codes for *exploratory* and *research works* during my internship on cloud and snow detection for solar atlas purposes.

### Introduction

The recognition of clouds during day-time is one of the most crucial steps for Solar Resources
Analysis.
An accurate identification of clouds is needed to compute the clear-sky irradiance background and the attenuation superimposed by clouds. This work addresses the
empirical knowledge about spectral channels, and then deals with a bunch of methods for the
classification of clouds and snow from multispectral satellite images.
A test-based algorithm is proposed, as well as a prototype of Machine-Learning approach.

### Getting started

1. Clone the repo

2. Create and activate a virtual python 2 environment.

3. Install requirements. Public dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. Run the code(s)

### Disclaimers

Disclaimer 1: The goal was to iterate very quickly over research ideas; it was not to produce a future-proof or production-ready library.

Disclaimer 2: this public repo is a trimmed down version of a private repo, which contains both open-source code and proprietary code that cannot be shared.
Besides the modules listed in the `requirements.txt` file (e.g. `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `keras`, `scikit-image`, `opencv`, ...), three private libs (``nclib2``, ``himawari8`` and ``general_utils``) are required to run the code.


### Contributors

All the files publicly appearing on this repo were written by myself, for exploratory and research purposes.
